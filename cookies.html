            <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: June 1, 2023</p>
            
            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how TreeLink Services ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            
            <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, TreeLink Services) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).</p>
            
            <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
            <p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.</p>
            
            <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>1. Essential Website Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the website, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our site functions. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, however, as described below.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>2. Performance and Functionality Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable. These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>3. Analytics and Customization Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you. We use Google Analytics to help us analyze how users use the site.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>4. Advertising Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>5. Social Networking Cookies</h3>
                <p>These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our website through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>6. Persistent Cookies</h3>
                <p>Persistent cookies remain on your personal computer or mobile device when you go offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser. We use both session and persistent cookies on our website to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>7. Flash Cookies</h3>
                <p>We may use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as Flash cookies) are used to provide functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>8. Pixel Tags</h3>
                <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies like pixel tags (sometimes called "web beacons" or "clear GIFs") to collect information about your use of our website and your response to our emails. These are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>9. Device Information</h3>
                <p>We may collect information about the device you're using to access our website, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information depends on what type of device you're using and its settings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>10. Log Files</h3>
                <p>Like many websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>11. Cookie Duration</h3>
                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer or mobile device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your computer or mobile device until they expire or are deleted.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>12. First-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>First-party cookies are cookies set by the website you're visiting. Only that website can read them. In addition, a website might potentially use external services which also set their own cookies, known as third-party cookies.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>13. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                <p>Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, we might have a Facebook "like" button on our site. That button will set a cookie that can be read by Facebook. That would be considered a third-party cookie.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>14. SameSite Cookies</h3>
                <p>SameSite cookies let servers require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). SameSite cookies are supported by Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera, and are being implemented in other browsers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>15. Secure Cookies</h3>
                <p>A secure cookie is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol. Even with Secure, sensitive information should never be stored in cookies, as they are inherently insecure and this flag can't offer real protection.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>16. HTTPOnly Cookies</h3>
                <p>An HttpOnly cookie cannot be accessed by client-side APIs, such as JavaScript. This restriction eliminates the threat of cookie theft via cross-site scripting (XSS). However, the cookie remains vulnerable to cross-site tracing (XST) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>17. Zombie Cookies</h3>
                <p>Zombie cookies are cookies that are recreated after a user has deleted them. This is accomplished by a script storing the cookie's content in multiple locations, such as Flash Local shared objects, HTML5 Web storage, and other client-side storage locations, then recreating the cookie when any of the other storage locations survive deletion.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>18. Supercookies</h3>
                <p>Supercookies are tracking cookies that are difficult to remove because they're stored in multiple places on your computer. They can be used to recreate a user's profile even after regular cookies have been deleted. We do not use supercookies on our website.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>19. Cookie Syncing</h3>
                <p>Cookie syncing is a process that allows different advertising platforms to share information about users by matching cookies. This enables advertisers to target users across different platforms and websites. We may participate in cookie syncing with trusted advertising partners.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="contact-point">
                <h3>20. Cookie Matching</h3>
                <p>Cookie matching is a technique used to link different identifiers for the same user across different devices or platforms. This helps create a more complete picture of user behavior across multiple touchpoints. We may use cookie matching to improve our advertising effectiveness.</p>
